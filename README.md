# Turn the WoW character feed API into RSS

Does exactly what it says. Only configured for US accounts right now, without an API key.
If you need it to be high volume, you'll want to first set up some caching locally and then
switch to using an API key and making signed calls (but that means a lot more code).

This is just to test some stuff, not designed to be used publically.
